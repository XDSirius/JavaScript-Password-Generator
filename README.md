# JavaScript-Password-Generator
This weeks's challenge was to create a password generator using only Javascript. The goal was to generate a password after asking a series of prompts to customize the perfect password for the user. This is to help and ensure the user have stronger passwords for safer and secure accounts.

## Installation

No installation required. 
The password generator is live at this link:
https://xdsirius.github.io/JavaScript-Password-Generator/


## Usage 
To correctly use this website, you first click on the "Generate Password" button at the bottom of the box. The program will then ask you several questions regarding if you want upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters in your password. Once all prompts have a valid input, the program will generate a random password that meets the criteria selected.
